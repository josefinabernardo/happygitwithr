## Program for today

-  Get started with GitHub
    -  15 New project, GitHub first
    -  16 Existing project, GitHub first
    -  17 Existing project, GitHub last
    -  18 Test drive R Markdown
    -  19 Render an R script
-  Git fundamentals?

## Get started with GitHub

-  New project? Easiest way: GitHub first
-  Existing project?
    -  GitHub first: pragmatic
    -  GitHub last: more proper way to connect, especially if already a Git history
    
## New project? Easiest way: GitHub first - Why?

-  Also sets up local Git repo for immediate pulling and pushing
-  Under the hood, we are doing git clone
-  The remote GitHub repo is configured as the origin remote for your local repo and your local main branch is now tracking the main on GitHub

## New project? Easiest way: GitHub first - Steps 1/n

-  Make a repo on GitHub
![](newrepo.png){.fragment}  
-  Click the big green “<> Code” button, and copy a clone URL to your clipboard
![](copyurl.png){.fragment}

## New project? Easiest way: GitHub first - Steps 2/n

-  Make a new RStudio Project preferably via (run in any RConsole / R session):  

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
usethis::create_from_github(
  repo_spec = "https://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO.git",
  destdir = "~/path/to/where/you/want/the/local/repo/"
)
```

. . . 

-  This creates a new local directory in `destdir`, which is:
   -  a directory or folder on your computer
   -  a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository
   -  an RStudio Project
-  This opens a new RStudio instance in the new Project
-  In the absence of other constraints, Jenny suggest that all of your R projects have exactly this set-up.


## New project? Easiest way: GitHub first - work, save & commit {.smaller}

-  Work on project, then click on `Git` tab:
![](git.png){.fragment}
-  Open `commit` screen by click on `Commit` button in git menu:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column .fragment width='60%'}
![](commit.png)
:::

::: {.column  width='40%'}

-  check boxes of things you like to commit
-  add `Commit` message
-  hit `Commit` button at bottom
:::

::::


## New project? Easiest way: GitHub first - push {.smaller}

-  New work in your local Git repository, not online yet
-  **Pull** from GitHub 
    -  Why? Establish this habit for the future! If you make changes to the repo in the browser or from another machine or (one day) a collaborator has pushed, you will be happier if you pull those changes in before you attempt to push.

![](pull.png){.fragment}

    -  Probably nothing will happen, i.e. you’ll get the message “Already up-to-date.” This is just to establish a habit.

-   Click the green “Push” button to send your local changes to GitHub:
![](push.png){.fragment}
. . .  

But then this happened:
